-- üìä Purpose   : Create Gold Layer Views for Direct Analytics & Queries
-- üìù Description:
--   - Builds dimensional and fact views optimized for BI tools and reports
--   - Leverages surrogate keys for consistent joins across dimensions/facts
--   - Transforms raw Silver layer data into analytics-ready datasets
--
-- üì¶ Included Views:
--   1. gold.dim_customers ‚Üí Combines CRM & ERP customer info with location
--   2. gold.dim_products  ‚Üí Merges CRM product data with ERP category mapping
--   3. gold.fact_sales    ‚Üí Transactional sales fact table linked to dimensions
--
-- üõ† Business Logic Highlights:
--   - Surrogate keys created with ROW_NUMBER for each dimension
--   - Gender prioritized from CRM, fallback to ERP, else 'N/A'
--   - Products filtered to only latest active version (prd_end_dt IS NULL)
--   - Fact table joins product & customer dimensions for complete context
--
-- üéØ Use Case:
--   - Designed for direct querying by analysts
--   - Ready to connect to visualization tools (Power BI, Tableau, Looker)
